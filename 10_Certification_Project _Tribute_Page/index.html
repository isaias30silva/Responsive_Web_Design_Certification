        <p id="tribute-info" class="tribute-info">Lauper grew up in Queens, New York. An indifferent student, she eventually dropped out of high school, and for the next several years, she worked at a number of assorted jobs and sang popular songs in nightclubs. After she suffered an injury to her vocal cords in 1977, she began to study under a vocal coach. That same year she and fellow musician John Turi formed the rockabilly band Blue Angel, and for the first time, Lauper publicly performed songs that she had had a hand in writing. Critics praised Lauper’s piercing and multihued vocals, and the band won a recording contract and released an eponymous album in 1980 on the Polydor label. Commercial success eluded them, however, and in 1982 Blue Angel was dissolved.</p>
